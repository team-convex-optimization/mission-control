# Mission Control

This script is meant to allow easy pipeline configuration while running the car headless (no terminal access).
To let this happens, please ensure this program is `System Setup` correctly.

## System Setup

1) Give the scripts the required permission `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
2) Add `launch_script.py &` to /etc/rc.local

That's it! (in theory)
